In this application we have three pages: orders page, products page and contacts page. On the orders page a list of all orders is displayed. On each order card there is the name of the order, the number of products in this order, the date and total cost of all products in this order, as well as a delete button. There is an opportunity to see the details. 

The product page also benefits from a card-style list of products, where there is the name of the product, its status, date, price and the ability to delete. There is also a select here to select a product by type. 

In the header of the site there is a search engine with which you can find the desired order or the desired product. You can also see the current date and time in the site header. 

On the contact page you can find all the information about the developer of this site.

In the footer of the site there is a link to the contact page.
